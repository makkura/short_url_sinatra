This project contains the code to create a light clone of standard URL shorteners like Bit.ly
It is based off of a screencast found here: http://screencasts.org/episodes/activerecord-with-sinatra

It follows a basic flow of:
	- Installation
	- Sinatra Configuration
	- Sinatra APP details (basic)
	- SQLite database migration with Rake
	- Sinatra APP details (routes to Haml Views)
	- Haml View creation
	- Sinatra APP (details & features)

It's all in the tutorial.
Note that a different url format regex was used to avoid UTF-8 vs ASCII encoding issues.
